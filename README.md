# data-structure-vector-pointer

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project consists of implementing the std::vector data structure using dynamic arrays utilizing raw pointers.
Vectors are known as dynamic arrays for their ability to grow and shrink in size unlike traditional arrays that are bound by it's initialized size.
Memory management is handled internally using "new" and "delete".
